Overview
This specification outlines the development plan for the game "Four-in-a-Row with Rotating Grid." 
It's a single page app for two players.
The development is broken down into incremental steps to simplify debugging and ensure each component works correctly before moving on to the next. The game will be implemented using modular JavaScript with a focus on maintainability, testability, and scalability.

Incremental Development Steps
Step 1: Basic Board Display and Stone Placement
Objective:

Implement a static 6x6 grid displayed on the screen.
Allow players to place stones on the grid without any animations or gravity.
No turn-based logic or win detection.
Features to Implement:

Board Rendering:
Display a 6x6 grid using HTML elements or a canvas.
Stone Placement:
Allow users to click on a cell or use keyboard input to place a stone directly into any cell.
Stones are placed where the user indicates, without gravity or movement.
Reset Game:
Provide a button to reset the game, clearing the board.
Step 2: Add Turn-Based Gameplay and Win Detection
Objective:

Implement alternating turns between two players.
Add logic to check for winning conditions after each move.
Provide basic UI feedback indicating the current player's turn and game outcome.
Features to Implement:

Turn Management:
Alternate turns between Player 1 (white stones) and Player 2 (black stones).
Win Detection:
Check for four stones in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally after each move.
Announce the winner or detect a draw if the board is full.
UI Updates:
Display which player's turn it is.
Show a message when the game ends (win or draw).
Step 3: Implement Gravity for Stone Placement
Objective:

Introduce gravity so that stones fall to the lowest available position in a column.
Modify stone placement to simulate dropping stones into columns.
Features to Implement:

Gravity Simulation:
When a stone is placed in a column, it occupies the lowest available cell in that column.
Input Handling:
Allow players to select a column rather than a specific cell.
Stones cannot be placed in full columns.
Update Win Detection:
Ensure win detection logic accounts for the new stone placement mechanism.
Step 4: Add Stone Dropping Animation
Objective:

Animate stones falling into place when dropped into a column.
Enhance the visual appeal and user experience.
Features to Implement:

Animation of Stone Falling:
Implement smooth animation of stones falling from the top of the column to their final position.
Adjust Rendering:
Ensure that during the animation, the stone is not prematurely added to the grid.
Input Handling During Animation:
Prevent player input while animations are in progress to maintain game state integrity.
Step 5: Implement Game Reset Functionality
Objective:

Ensure the game can be properly reset after a win, draw, or by player choice.
Clear all game state and prepare for a new game.
Features to Implement:

Reset Game State:
Clear the board, reset timers (if any), and set the starting player.
UI Updates:
Reset any UI elements indicating the game state or winner.
Input Handling:
Ensure all event listeners are correctly reset.
Step 6: Add Grid Rotation Mechanic without Animation
Objective:

Implement the grid rotation logic that rotates the grid 90 degrees counterclockwise.
Reapply gravity after rotation to adjust stone positions.
Features to Implement:

Rotation Logic:
Rotate the grid data structure.
After rotation, apply gravity to all stones.
Trigger Rotation:
Provide a button to manually trigger rotation (useful for testing).
Update Rendering:
Ensure the grid is re-rendered correctly after rotation and gravity application.
Step 7: Add Rotation Animation
Objective:

Animate the grid rotation to visually represent the 90-degree counterclockwise turn.
Animate stones falling to their new positions after rotation.
Features to Implement:

Grid Rotation Animation:
Implement smooth rotation animation of the grid.
Post-Rotation Gravity Animation:
Animate stones falling to their new positions after rotation.
Synchronize Animations:
Ensure that the rotation animation completes before stones start falling.
Disable Input During Animations:
Prevent player actions while animations are in progress.
Step 8: Implement Rotation Timer
Objective:

Add a timer that automatically triggers grid rotation every 30 seconds.
Handle the interaction between rotation timing and player turns.
Features to Implement:

Rotation Timer:
Display a countdown timer indicating time until the next rotation.
Rotation Timing Rules:
If the timer reaches zero during a player's turn, wait until the player completes their move before rotating.
Timer Reset:
Reset the rotation timer after each rotation.
Step 9: Implement Turn Timer
Objective:

Add a timer for each player's turn, with a 1-minute limit.
Enforce the rule that a player loses if they don't make a move within the time limit.
Features to Implement:

Turn Timer:
Display a countdown timer for the current player's turn.
Enforce Turn Time Limit:
If the timer reaches zero, declare the current player as the loser.
Timer Reset:
Reset the turn timer at the beginning of each player's turn.
Step 10: Refine UI and Add Final Features
Objective:

Polish the user interface, making sure all elements are responsive and accessible.
Add any remaining features such as visual indicators, responsive design adjustments, and final testing.
Features to Implement:

UI Enhancements:
Improve the layout and styling for better aesthetics.
Ensure that the game is responsive on tablets and desktops.
Accessibility:
Ensure keyboard navigation works smoothly.
Add any necessary ARIA labels or other accessibility features.
Final Testing:
Thoroughly test all features to identify and fix any remaining bugs.
